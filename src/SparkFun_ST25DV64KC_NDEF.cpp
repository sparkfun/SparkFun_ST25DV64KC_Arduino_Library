  The Capacity Container File is written to the first eight bytes of user memory:

  0xE2 0x40 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x03 0xFF

  Byte 0: Magic Number
          The ST25DV64KC has 8kBytes of user memory so we need to select 0xE2 to select two-byte addressing
  Byte 1: Version and Access Condition
          b7 b6 = 0b01 Major Version
          b5 b4 = 0b00 Minor Version
          b3 b2 = 0x00 Read Access: Always
          b1 b0 = 0x00 Write Access: Always
  Byte 2: 0x00
  Byte 3: Additional Feature Information
          b7 b6 b5 = 0b000 RFU (Reserved Future Use)
          b4 = 0b0 Special Frame
          b3 = 0b0 Lock Block
          b2 b1 = 0b00 RFU
          b0 = 0b1 MBREAD: Read Multiple Block is supported
  Byte 4: 0x00 RFU (Reserved Future Use)
  Byte 5: 0x00 RFU (Reserved Future Use)
  Byte 6 + Byte 7: MLEN Encoded Memory Length
          MLEN = T5T_Area / 8
          MLEN encoding for a ST25DV64K (8192 bytes memory size) and 8 bytes capability container (CC):
          If the entire user memory full, user memory is used to store NDEF, T5T_Area=8192-8
          MLEN = (8192 â€“ 8) / 8 = 1023 (0x03FF)
